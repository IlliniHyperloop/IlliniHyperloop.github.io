								<h2>Mizan Rahman</h2>
								<p>Founder & Co-President</p>
							</header>
							<p>Mizan is a third year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. As an aspiring engineer, he has come a long way from his home in Fremont, California to one of the greatest engineering schools in the world. He began building robots at the age of 12, later going on to design and build BattleBots at the University of Illinois. His father used to race a 1983 Mazda RX-7, so cars and racing were in his blood from a young age. </p>
							<p>Mizan became naturally enthralled by anything that went fast, so when he got to UIUC he joined the Formula SAE Racing team, working on Aerodynamics. His natural tendency to lead by example proved to be a defining trait of his. After hearing about the SpaceX Hyperloop competition, he asked his buddy since freshman year, Seth Faletsky, to help him lead the project. The two work perfectly together, and are excited to be leading students at the University of Illinois in such a pivotal project. Mizan sees the Hyperloop as a potential transportation system that could make the world a smaller place, as well as improve worldwide economics if it were implemented on a larger scale. Being a California native has given Mizan some emotional attachment to the project, as he has made the grueling 6 hour drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles many times. A Hyperloop transportation system is something he would love to use some time in the near future.</p>
