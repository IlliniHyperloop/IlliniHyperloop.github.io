								<h2>Seth Faletsky</h2>
								<p>Co-President</p>
							</header>
							<p>Seth is a third year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. Seth hails from a northern suburb of Chicago. He took up an interest in carpentry at the age of 13 and began building cabinets and desks.</p>
							<p>His family has a long history of sailing, which sparked his interest in boating. Due to his natural love of boats and carpentry, at the age of 17 he built a small wooden one design boat. After completing this challenge he decided it was time to pursue other interests. During his time in high school he received his first job as an electricianâ€™s apprentice where he not only learned about the electrical business, but also about project management. After coming to the University of Illinois, Seth decided to use his manufacturing knowledge and his love of creating to build robots. As time progressed Seth was ready to take on new challenges, so with his buddy Mizan Rahman, he decided to take on the challenge of building a Hyperloop.</p>
