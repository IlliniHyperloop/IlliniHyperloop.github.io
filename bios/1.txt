Mizan is a third year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As an aspiring engineer, he has come a long way from his home in Fremont, California to one of the greatest engineering schools in the world. He began building robots at the age of 12, later going on to design and build BattleBots at the University of Illinois. His father used to race a 1983 Mazda RX-7, so cars and racing were in his blood from a young age.
