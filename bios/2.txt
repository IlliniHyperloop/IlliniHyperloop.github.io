Scott is a senior Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has always had a keen interest into how things work and subsequently has been tinkering and building since he could use tools. One of the highlights of his tinkering hobby is the rocket motors and associated production tooling he developed from scratch, by himself.
