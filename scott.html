								<h2>Scott Qualkenbush</h2>
								<p>VP of Engineering</p>
							</header>
							<p>Scott is a senior Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has always had a keen interest into how things work and subsequently has been tinkering and building since he could use tools. One of the highlights of his tinkering hobby is the rocket motors and associated production tooling he developed from scratch, by himself.</p>
							<p>This project prompted him to find a passion in space and space related technologies which would later result in accepting internships with Orbital ATK and SpaceX. Scott also has a track record of participating in many extracurricular projects and student groups at UIUC. He led an innovative product development team in the organization i-Invent, created projects to improve the engineering student experience on campus as board member and then chairman of Engineering Initiative, and co-founded Makers UIUC which is an organization where students form teams and build any project they can think of (within reason) and he acted as VP, President, Team Leader, and Team Member. The Hyperloop project was instantly appealing to him because it was an advanced and innovative project competition, hosted by SpaceX, which will have a real and beneficial impact on the world. He joined the student interest group and helped the leadership form an RSO in record time; he also joined the senior design team which is assigned to the project. He is very excited to work on this amazing opportunity and looks forward to the finishing the Hyperloop pod and competing with it at SpaceX in the summer of 2016.</p>
