								<h2>Nick Woodrich</h2>
								<p>Safety/Reliability Subsystem Lead</p>
							</header>
							<p>Nick is a junior in Construction Management with a secondary in Structural Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is from Geneva, Illinois, which for people not from Illinois, or not from the Geneva area, is about an hour out of Chicago.</p>
							<p>Inspired at a young age by Legos, construction equipment, and design of structures, Civil Engineering and more specifically structures and CM were an obvious choice. In addition to this, a passion for progress and global impact in engineering and business practices have driven him to pursue new and exciting opportunities, always keeping an eye on the future of society as a whole. This has led him to join the Structural Engineerâ€™s Association, American Society of Civil Engineers, and Illini Hyperloop to meet like-minded individuals who have progress-oriented energy and are looking to make a positive impact in our world. Hyperloop particularly piqued his interest because implementing an advance in transportation that is so drastically superior to anything prior would bring about significant positive change in a fairly short window. Accounting for scalability, the implications of a Hyperloop system would benefit both the commercial, public, and government markets significantly, and he would love to have a hand in seeing that happen.</p>
