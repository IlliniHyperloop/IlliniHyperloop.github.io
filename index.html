Illini Hyperloop is a group of students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who are 
participating in the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition. We are comprised of a Senior Design Team and 
a Registered Student Organization. The Senior Design Team is a group of seniors that have chosen the 
Hyperloop concept as their Senior Design Project. We have seniors from Aerospace Engineering, 
Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Mechanics, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and 
Computer Science working on the project. The Registered Student Organization (RSO) is a student-run 
club that was started over the summer in order to bring together all the interest at UIUC. It is an all-
inclusive club, open to the entire student body and not restricted to any discipline. The club seeks talent 
throughout the entire school to create the most well rounded team in this competition. Together we make 
a strong team, representative of the countless brilliant scholars at the University of Illinois.

												Mizan is a third year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As an aspiring engineer, he has come a 

												long way from his home in Fremont, California to one of the greatest engineering schools in the world. He began building robots at the age of 12, 

												later going on to design and build BattleBots at the University of Illinois. His father used to race a 1983 Mazda RX-7, so cars and racing were in 

												his blood from a young age.
