				<p class="title">Who We Are</p>	
				<p class= "para">
				Illini Hyperloop is a group of students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who are 
				participating in the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition. We are comprised of a Senior Design Team and 
				a Registered Student Organization. The Senior Design Team is a group of seniors that have chosen the 
				Hyperloop concept as their Senior Design Project. We have seniors from Aerospace Engineering, 
				Mechanical Engineering, Engineering Mechanics, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and 
				Computer Science working on the project. 
				</p>	
				<p class= "para paralast">
				The Registered Student Organization (RSO) is a student-run 
				club that was started over the summer in order to bring together all the interest at UIUC. It is an all-
				inclusive club, open to the entire student body and not restricted to any discipline. The club seeks talent 
				throughout the entire school to create the most well rounded team in this competition. Together we make 
				a strong team, representative of the countless brilliant scholars at the University of Illinois.

				<p class="title subTitle">Aerodynamics</p>	
				<p class= "para subPara">
				The aerodynamics subsystem is responsible for minimizing drag, routing air through the pod, 
				ensuring we don't create shock waves in the tube, calculating the drag due to our levitation system, and 
				investigating ways to produce thrust. We are using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), computer aided 
				design (CAD), thermodynamics, and incompressible and compressible flows to do all of this. Creative 
				and critical thinking skills are essential to make smart assumptions and approximations in the design 
				phase.
				</p>
		</section>
		<section class = "subPara" id = "sp2">
				<p class="title subTitle">Chassis</p>	
				<p class= "para subPara">
				The Chassis Subsystem is designing and will build the structural frame of the pod which is 
				essentially that of a high speed train. They are also responsible for the braking systems which are inspired 
				by components on an airplane. The chassis team will be doing FEA to ensure structural integrity of the 
				design.
				</p>
		</section>
		<section class = "subPara" id = "sp3">
				<p class="title subTitle">Electronics</p>	
				<p class= "para subPara">
				The Electronics Subsystem is focusing on sensor networks, power distribution, cooling systems, 
				and control logic. They are creating a graphical user interface, and ensuring subsystem concurrency. 
				There will be a great deal of fabrication during the second semester.
				</p>
		</section>
		<section class = "subPara" id = "sp4">
				<p class="title subTitle">Power</p>	
				<p class= "para subPara">
				The Power team Is responsible for managing the power requirements and wiring of all on board components. 
				The team will be responsible for obtaining and attaching the Arx Pax hover engines to the pod. 
				The team will also be creating the batteries and cooling system that will be used in the pod. 
				</p>
		</section>
		<section class = "subPara" id = "sp5">
				<p class="title subTitle">Manufacturing</p>	
				<p class= "para subPara">
				The Manufacturing Subsystem is in charge of creating testing platforms as well as ensuring all 
				designs can be fabricated. We are looking into different manufacturing methods to find the best way to 
				build the pod. We will be learning various manufacturing techniques in order to be sufficiently prepared 
				to build the pod second semester.
